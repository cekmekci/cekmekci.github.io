Hi! My name is [Canberk Ekmekci](http://ipa-reader.xyz/?text=d%CA%92anb%C9%9B%C9%BEk%CA%B0%20ek%CC%9Fmek%CC%9Fd%CA%92i). I am a Ph.D. student at the Signal, Data, and Imaging Sciences Laboratory, University of Rochester, New York, USA. My main research area is computational imaging. I am currently focusing on Plug-and-Play methods, deep unrolling methods, uncertainty quantification, and learning-based modeling for imaging applications. I have a strong interest in image reconstruction, statistical modeling and inference, machine learning, and convex optimization.
